A study by the University of California, Berkeley's Center for Applied Environmental Studies (CEEAS), has found that the use of "fungicide" or "toxic chemical" for human use is a growing problem for the planet.

The study, published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, shows that more than 1 in 5 people in the United States and Canada, and more than 1 in 10 people in Europe, are exposed to chemical herbicides and herbicides as a result of exposure to certain chemicals.

It's not much of a stretch to say that there are very few ways to prevent human exposure to chemical herbicides and herbicides. The vast majority of the chemicals used in the world are used at the highest levels, and most are either used with or without human intervention. Yet, that's where our "fungicide" problem becomes more problematic.

"In the last 10 years or so, about half of all the global chemical herbicides and herbicides used in the world have resulted in human-caused impacts," says co-author Richard L. Muhlberg, director of the UCSB Center for Applied Environmental Studies.

In 2010, for instance, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released a
